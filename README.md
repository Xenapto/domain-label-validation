Domain name label validation
============================

A regex for correctly validating a domain label according to RFCs 1035 &amp; 1123

The starting point for this code was the fragment contributed by [Mark Byers](http://stackoverflow.com/users/61974/mark-byers) in [this StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2063213/regular-expression-for-validating-dns-label-host-name "Regular Expression for validating DNS label ( host name)") for which I am grateful.
